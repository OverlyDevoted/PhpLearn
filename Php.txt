Php is run on the server and not the browser 
it's run on the 80% of all the websites 
php hypertext preprocessor 
HOW DOES PHP WORK?:
client from his browser sends a http request to the php web server which in return processes the request and sends a html response to the client' browser
the php server can also communicate with a database and is usually paired with sql databases (mysql, microsoft sql server, postgres, oracle) 

PHP can be written alongside html so a solid foundation of htmml is needed 
XAMMP is a crossplatform webserver stack and is a software suite and contains different types of softwares 

$_GET and $_POST are special variables that are used to collect
data from a form. Basically in the form tag you reference a php file to which
u'd send data and on submittion it's then sent to that file
<form action="some_file.php" method="get">
any data sent through a get form is appended to the url
so you could look at the lesson 4 code and u'd see after submitting the
form the link would look like this: 
http://localhost/website/index.php?username=K3ymn&password=Ilikebigcock
when using method="post" the values are not appended to the URL so it's in  way more secure
$_GET =     Data is appended to the url
            NOT secure
            char limit
            bookmark is possible w/ values
            get request can be cached 
            better for a search page

$_POST =    Data is packaged inside the body of the HTTP request
            MORE secure
            no data limit
            Cannot bookmark duh
            GET requests are not cached
            Better for submitting credentials
